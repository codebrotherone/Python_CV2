This is code (finished or not, without refactoring) that aligns with the Projects and Assignments from Georgia Tech's
Introduction to Computer Vision Course. 

This is meant to reflect some of the work I have done in that class -- and this repository will eventually
be reorganized and built upon over time. 

THIS repo is meant to encompass all computer vision concepts using python :

  - cv2
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - python
  
Enjoy!
